        <h2>Profile</h2>
         <p >
            I am a professional aircraft and software engineer who has been loved by everyone that I have worked with. I have led many engineers through complicated projects that were believed to have been completed over a long period of time. However, implementing the valuable skills gained through what i consider my tough learning period, we were able to complete those projects in a matter of days.
            As a young African living in an area where technology is not widely available, I have always dreamed of creating a professional-looking technical environment where everyone will have access to affordable technologies where they can implement and showcase their ideals. Based on this, I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. Through my journing as Full Stack developer I have been working on project that will help to shape the world arround me. I love writing code that makes valuable decisions based on human intellect. <a href="info.html" > Learn More</a></p>
